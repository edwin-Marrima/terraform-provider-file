# file_transformer (Data Source)

The `file_transformer` data source provides an interface between terraform and the file system running terraform, allowing to overwrite, delete/edit file contents. The `file_transformer` data source can be used with existing or non-existing files, currently supported file extensions are json, .env and yaml (or yml)
			
~> **Warning** It is necessary that you grant sufficient permissions (_chmod +rw_) so that the provider can read and make changes to the contents of the specified file .If the file does not exist, the `file` provider will try to create a new file or subfolder, so the permissions must also cover these situations.

## Example Usage

### Convert file with json format to yaml

```terraform
data "file_transformer" "foo" {
  file                 = "./foo1.json"
  output               = "./foo2.yml"
  override_array_items = true
  items = jsonencode(
		{
			"name"="bar"
		}
	)
}
```
### DotEnv File (.env)

~> NOTE: When the file extension is _.env_ only _file_ and items are taken into account (so filling in the other properties has no effect).

```terraform

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "foo_s3" {
    bucket = "bar"
}

data "file_transformer" "foo" {
  file                 = "./subfolder/.env"
  items = <<EOT
    BUCKET_ARN=aws_s3_bucket.foo_s3.arn
    USERNAME=foo123
	EOT
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `file` - (Required) Source file, if  `output` property is empty, the content provided in the `items` field will be merged with the content of this file and the result of the merge will be saved in the given file. Currently supported file extensions are _json, .env and yaml (or yml)_. 

* `items` - (Required) Content to be placed in the file, however it's necessary to encode the value to a string using JSON syntax, thus we advise to use the terraform built-in function `jsonencode` to assign any value to this property. 

* `output` - (Optional) Destination file. Defaults to the file given in `file` property.

* `override_array_items` - (Optional) In situations where the object defined in the `items` field contains a _Key_ whose associated value is array and the same _Key_ exists (on the same level) in the specified file, if this field is false then the key values (defined in the `items` field and specified file) will be merged, on the other hand if this field is set to true, then the value associated with the same _Key_ in the selected file will be replaced by the value (associated with the _Key_) defined in the `items` field. This setting is only applicable to json and yaml files. Defaults to `true`.

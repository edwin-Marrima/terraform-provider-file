# File Provider

`File` is a special provider that exists to provide an interface between Terraform and file system.

Terraform's design allows it to be more than an _IAC_ tool, terraform can be used to streamline the _CI/CD process_. 

After running _terraform apply_ a lot of metadata are generated, and sometimes there is a need to pass some metadata to specific files, for instance, after creating an s3 bucket there may be a need to pass the _arn_ to _docker-compose.yml_ file as environment variable, _.env_ file or even a json file whose purpose is to generate a report with created resource metadata (to do whatever).


<!-- ## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "scaffolding" {
  # example configuration here
}
```
